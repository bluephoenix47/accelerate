Requirements: 
- Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), 6.12.1 or later
- Haskell libraries as specified in 'accelerate.cabal'
- For the CUDA backend, CUDA version 3.0 or later

Standard Cabal installation:

  % runhaskell Setup.hs configure --prefix=INSTALLPATH
  % runhaskell Setup.hs build
  % runhaskell Setup.hs install
    OR
    runhaskell Setup.hs install -- user

Then, to use the library, pass the flag "-package accelerate" to GHC.
